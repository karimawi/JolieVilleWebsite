        A concept front-end website for the Jolie Ville Hotel in Luxor, written with Bootstrap 5.3 as an assignment for my web course at college
    <p/>
  <br>
</p>
<br>

## üìù A Few Things To Note:
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>I did not have the time to make the website responsive or phone-ready so consider opening it on a desktop browser</li>
      <li>There're some janky CSS around in terms of resizing and scaling which may not be the most compatible but I did my best with the time I had, so consider zooming in/out if you have scaling issues</li>
      <li>There's no back-end to this, it's just a front-end project</li>
    </ul>
